# Semaphore Trusted Setup Ceremony

Semaphore is a zero-knowledge protocol for anonymous signaling on Ethereum, enabling users to prove membership in a group and broadcast signals. Such as votes, endorsements, or messages. Without revealing their identity.

## Contribute
You can contribute to the ceremony using either a web browser or the command-line interface (CLI).

- Web-browser: Simply connect your github in ceremoy.pse.dev, press on Contribute and wait for your contribution to finish.
- CLI: Follow the below guide to install and participate the ceremony in a terminal using command-line. This method is way more stable than the web version.

## Install Ceremony
### Step 1. Create a directory in your home folder to run the ceremony from:
```
mkdir ~/trusted-setup && cd ~/trusted-setup
```

### Step 2: Install CLI:
```
npm install -g @p0tion/phase2cli
```

### Step 3: Authenticate with GitHub:
To contribute to the ceremony, youâ€™ll need a legit GitHub account.

Run this command in your terminal:
```
phase2cli auth
```

* Copy the provided auth code in terminal and paste in the auth page . Click "Authorize" to continue.

## Contribute Ceremony
### Open a screen
Open a screen so the ceremony keeps going in the backgroundâ€”might take hours before itâ€™s your turn.
* Screen is useful for VPS, not WSL. If you close the terminal in WSL, your screen session is killed
```
screen -S semaphore
```

### Contribute to the ceremony
```
phase2cli contribute -c semaphore-binary-merkle-root-fix
```
* You can either hit enter for randomly, or pick manually and type any letter or number yourself.

### Screen commands
* Minimize screen: `Ctrl`+`A`+`D`
* Return to screen: `screen -r semaphore`
* Kill ceremony when inside screen: `Ctrl`+`C`
* Kill screen when inside screen: `Ctrl`+`D`
* Kill screen when outside screen: `screen -XS semaphore quit`
* screens list: `screen -ls`

## Notes:
* Contributing may take some time, depending on the number of circuits (**32 in this run**) and the queue of contributors.
* If your connection is interrupted or an error occurs, simply re-run the same command â€” it will pick up from where it left off.

### After completing your contribution, you will be invited to share a message on X or your preferred social platform! ðŸŽ‰

## Cleanup & Logout
After completing your contribution to the ceremony, itâ€™s recommended to clean up your local files and revoke GitHub authorization for security:
```
phase2cli clean
```
```
phase2cli logout
```
Delete the ceremony folder too if you donâ€™t need it:
```
rm -rf ~/trusted-setup
```
